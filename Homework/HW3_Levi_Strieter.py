You need to control the number of people who can be in
an oyster bar at the same time. Groups of people can always leave the bar, 
but a group cannot enter the bar if they would make the number of people in the 
bar exceed the maximum of 100 occupants. Write a program that reads the 
sizes of the groups that arrive or depart. Use negative numbers for departures. 
After each input, display the current number of occupants. As soon as the bar holds 
the maximum number of people, report that the bar is full and exit the program.
