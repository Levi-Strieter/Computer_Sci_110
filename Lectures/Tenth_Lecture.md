###### Random Numbers
```python
import random 

for i  in range(5):
    print(random.random()) # prints anythng from 0 to less than 1

# .3423849835
# .3784t27334
```
- also have randint(start, end)
    - inclusive 

###### Monte Carlo Simulation
running somehting many times with random numbers
- pros 
    - efficient and fast
    - low computing power
    - errors are clear
- cons
    - psuedo-random numbers
