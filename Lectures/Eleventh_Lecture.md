# Lists 

##### Aliasing 

- a list points to the same list, it does not create new variable
    ```python
        ListA = ["a", "b"]
        ListB = ListA # ListB just points to ListA (a new variable ListB is not created)
    ```

##### slicing 
- can get a start point and end point of list
    - x = ListA[0:2] # ListA[:2]
    - ["A", "B"]

##### Tuple 
- read only List 
    - list can't be changed or modified at all
    - can find the max and min and index the tuple
