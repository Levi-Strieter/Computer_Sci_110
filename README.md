<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

These are all the notes for the cs 110 at marshall university with professor Wahjudi teaching. I use some more advanced programming that isn't convered in lectures so my code is probably not the best to copy. ADDED SUPPORT FOR JUPYTER NOTEBOOK!!

Here's why:
* Has all the labs with instructions on how to complete 
* Has all hw assignments with example code 
* Has all lectures with notes taken in .md format 


### Language
The main language used for this class is python 3 and wing IDE; although, all notes I take and labs are completed in vscode.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
