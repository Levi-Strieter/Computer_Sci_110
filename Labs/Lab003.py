1.	Basic if else Statements to determine if a number is even or odd
#Divide the number by 2 and multiply by 2 if the result is same as #input then it is an even number else it is an odd number.
#ask user to enter an integer
#if the number is even, print the message that it is even
#else print the message that it is odd

2.	Use elif for exclusive conditions:
Ask the user for their age
if age < 13 print you are still a child if age < 20 print you are a teenager 
if age < 63 print you are an adult
else print you are a senior citizen
    ïƒ¨	This algorithm has a flaw if the user enters a negative number, please fix it.
